# D3-Challenge
<h4>Data Journalism and D3 <h4>
  The data set included with the assignment is based on 2014 ACS 1-year estimates from the [US Census Bureau](https://data.census.gov/cedsci/), but you are free to investigate a different data set. The current data set includes data on rates of income, obesity, poverty, etc. by state. MOE stands for "margin of error."
  
### Core Assignment: D3 Dabbler 
![scatter-1](images/scatter-1.PNG)
create a scatter plot between two of the data variables such as `Healthcare vs. Poverty` or `Smokers vs. Age`.

Using the D3 techniques , create a scatter plot that represents each state with circle elements. Coded this graphic in the `app.js` file and  pulled in the data from `data.csv` by using the `d3.csv` function. The scatter plot visually reprsents the data points in the file.

* Include state abbreviations in the circles.

* Create and situate the axes and labels to the left and bottom of the chart.

* Used `python -m http.server` to run the visualization. This will host the page at `localhost:8000` in your web browser.
